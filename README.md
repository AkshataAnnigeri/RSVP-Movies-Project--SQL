# RSVP-Movies-Project--SQL
### Introduction
RSVP Movies, an Indian film production company renowned for producing numerous super-hit movies, is planning to release a movie for a global audience in 2022. To ensure a data-driven approach for this new project, RSVP Movies has sought analytical assistance to gain meaningful insights from the data of movies released in the past three years.

### Objective
